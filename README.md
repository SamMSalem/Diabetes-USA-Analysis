# Diabetes Type 2 Analysis

## Overview:

Welcome to my analysis of type 2 diabetes, focusing on disease analysis in the USA and Marketing analysis for the top 3 drugs treating this disease. This project was created out of a desire to understand the causes of type 2 diabetes, prevalence, risk factors, and navigate the marketing analysis from the top 3 companies. It delves into the disease status in the USA market and companies' marketing performance to help find optimal marketing activities to tackle this disease.

The data was sourced from two separate sources, the USA disease data was sourced from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website, and the international disease data was sourced from the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). Due to the proprietary nature of pharmaceutical sales/marketing data, this project used a simulated dataset that mirrors a real-world scenario, in which the simulated data was supplemented with real figures for the drug sales and marketing expenditures from the company's 10-K filing. The data was created to demonstrate my ability to analyze key marketing metrics, including market share, sales trends, and campaign effectiveness. The simulated data contains detailed information on drug name, prescriptions filled, new patients started, sales revenue, marketing spend on digital Ads, marketing spend on Healthcare professionals, and competitors' prescriptions.

Total: 38.4 million people have diabetes (11.6% of the U.S. population)
Diagnosed: 29.7 million people, including 29.4 million adults
Undiagnosed: 8.7 million people (22.8% of adults with diabetes are undiagnosed)
